Solar System Simulation Using Three.js 
The Solar System Simulation project is a web-based 3D visualization developed using 
Three.js, a JavaScript library for rendering 3D graphics in the browser. The project aims 
to provide an interactive and visually engaging model of the solar system, where users 
can observe the motion of planets revolving around the Sun in real time. 
Traditional 2D diagrams often fail to clearly represent astronomical motion and spatial 
relationships. This project overcomes that limitation by using 3D rendering, animation 
loops, lighting, and camera controls to create a realistic simulation.
